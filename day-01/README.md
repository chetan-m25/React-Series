# ⚛️ React Learning Series – Day 01

* Welcome to **Day 01** of my **React Learning Series**   
* This repository documents my **first step into React**, where I learned how to **set up a React project using Vite**, understand the **basic React folder structure**, and revise the **JavaScript fundamentals required before React**.
* This series is focused on **learning by doing**, keeping everything **simple, practical, and beginner-friendly**.


## What I Learned on Day 01

On the first day, I focused on building a strong foundation by learning:

- How to create a **React project using Vite**
- Why **Vite** is used as a modern bundler
- Understanding the **React + Vite folder structure**
- Revising **important JavaScript concepts** needed before React
- How files like `main.jsx`, `App.jsx`, and `index.html` work together


## Why Vite?

Vite is a **modern frontend build tool** that provides:

- Extremely fast project setup
- Instant development server
- Faster reloads compared to older tools
- Clean and minimal React configuration

This makes it perfect for **learning React as a beginner**.


## 📂 Project Folder Structure

**Below is the basic folder structure of this React + Vite project :**
```
