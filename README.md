# Welcome to my React-Series ⚛️

**React Series** is a day by day React learning repository focused on building a strong foundation in modern frontend development.  
Each folder represents a specific day of learning, covering React concepts through hands on practice and small UI implementations.


## About This Repository

* This series follows a **learning by building** approach.  
* Instead of only studying theory, every day focuses on writing real React code, understanding component based architecture, and creating small but meaningful UI pieces.
* The goal is to grow gradually from basic React concepts to more practical and structured frontend development.
* Each folder includes a well documented **README** that clearly explains what was learned and implemented in a simple and easy to understand way on that specific day.
